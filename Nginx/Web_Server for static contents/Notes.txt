The configuration files of Nginx is stored at etc/nginx/

At here, there are 2 important folders are:
sites-enable and sites-available

* the sites-enable used to contains files which each file define the source code that the nginx will use to create website

* sites-available used to contains "symbolic link (or symlink)" files, which each file is marked as "l" at the beginning of the file permission string (lrwxrwxrwx), each file serves as a reference to another file or directory (in this case, each file will link to a specific file at 'sites-enable' folder)

* 'source code' usually stored at folder /var/www/<domain_name>/html/
