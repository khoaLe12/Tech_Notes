1. Von Neumann Architecture: Also known as the Princeton architecture, it is a computer architecture based on a 1945 description by the mathematician and physicist John von Neumann. This is a design model for a stored-program digital computer that uses a processing unit and a single separate storage structure to hold both instructions and data.

2. Harvard Architecture: It’s a computer architecture with separate storage and signal pathways for instructions and data. It contrasts with the Von Neumann architecture, where program instructions and data share the same memory and pathways.

3. Instruction Set Architecture (ISA): This is the part of the computer architecture related to programming, including the native data types, instructions, registers, addressing modes, memory architecture, interrupt and exception handling, and external I/O.

4. Microarchitecture: Also known as computer organization, this is a lower level description of a computer’s implementation. It describes how a particular processor will implement the ISA.

5. System Design: This includes all hardware components in the system, including data processors aside from the CPU, such as the graphics processing unit and direct memory access.

6. x86: This is a family of instruction set architectures initially developed by Intel but now maintained by many companies. It’s used in most personal computers today.

7. SPARC: Scalable Processor Architecture (SPARC) is a RISC instruction set architecture developed by Sun Microsystems.

8. PowerPC: This is a RISC instruction set architecture created by the 1991 Apple–IBM–Motorola alliance, known as AIM.

9. ARM: Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) is a type of processor architecture that is widely used in many mobile devices and embedded systems.

10. AVR: Developed by Atmel and popularized by the Arduino Uno, AVR is a family of microcontrollers.

The x86-64 (also known as x64, x86_64, AMD64, and Intel 64) is a 64-bit processor architecture that was introduced by AMD. It is an extension of the 32-bit x86 architecture used in PCs today, with additional features such as a larger number of general-purpose and floating-point registers and new instructions for manipulating and managing them.

The x86-64 architecture is backward compatible with x86, which means it can run software written for the 32-bit x86 architecture. This is achieved through two operating modes:

64-bit mode: Allows the execution of native 64-bit instructions, and access to 64-bit memory address space.
Compatibility mode: Allows the execution of existing 32-bit software.
So, in essence, a machine with an x86-64 processor can support both x86 (32-bit) and x64 (64-bit) instruction sets
