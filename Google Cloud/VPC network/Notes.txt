		****** VPC Network ******
1. When we create a project, it will create a default vpc network with subnets in each region automatically (auto mode of creating default vpc network)
2. Custom mode of creating vpc network starts with no subnets (fill control over subnet creation)



		****** Subnets ******
1. Is a subnetwork of a VPC
2. Each VPC network consists of one or more subnets and each subnet is associated with a region.
3. We can create more than one subnet per region.
4. We can not change the name OR region of a subnet after we have created it.
5. Primary and Secondary ranges for subnets cannot overlap with any allocated range.



		****** Increasing subnet IP space ******
1. Must not overlap with other subnets in the same VPC network.
2. Inside the RFC 1918 address-space.
3. Network range must be larger than the original (prefix length must be smaller than the old one).
4. Once subnet has been expanded, you cannot undo it.

ex: we can expand the space of ip address: /20 -> /16
    We can NOT reduce the space of ip address: /16 -> /20
    (One-way conversion)



		****** Reserved IP Addresses ****** 
1. Network - First address
2. Default Gateway - Second address
3. Second-to-last address - Google Cloud future use
4. Broadcast - Last address



		****** Routing and Private Google Access ****** 
1. Routes define the network traffic path from one destination to the other.
2. In a VPC routes consists of a single destination (CIDR) and a single next hop.
3. All routes are stored in the routing table for the VPC routing.
4. Each package leaving a VM is delivered to the next hop of an application route based on a routing order.



		****** Routing Types ******
I. System-generated
1. Default Route:
 _ When we create a VPC network, gg cloud created a system-generated default route
 _ Path to the Internet
 _ Path for Private Google Access
 _ Can be deleted only by replacing with custom route
 _ Lowest priority

2. Subnet Route:
 _ Routes that defines paths to each subnet in the VPC network.
 _ Each subnet has at least one subnet route whose destination matches the primary IP range of the subnet.
 _ When a subnet is created, a corresponding subnet route is created for both primary and secondary IP range.
 _ Cannot delete a subnet route unless you modify or delete the subnet.

II. Custom Routes
1. Static Route:
 _ Can use the next hop feature.
 _ Can be created manually.
 _ Static routes for the remote traffic selectors are created automatically when creating Cloud VPN tunnels

2. Dynamic Route
 _ Managed by one or more Cloud Routers
 _ Dynamically exchange routes between a VPC and on-premises networks
 _ Destination IP ranges outside the VPC network
 _ Used with dynamically routed VPNs and Interconnect



		****** Private Google Access ****** 
1. VM instances that ony have internal ip addresses can use private google access and this allow them to reach the external ip addresses of google api and services.
2. VM instances that have external ip address can access to the internet.
3. A VM can have both internal and external ip address.
4. VM instances within a VCP Network can access (communicate) to each other.
5. We can use private google access to connect to gg api and services from our own on-premises network through a cloud vpn tunnel or cloud interconnect.
6. We can also use private gg access through a vpc network peering connection (private services access).



		****** IP Addessing ******
 * INTERNAL (Private):
1. Not publicy advertised and used only within a network.
2. Resources with internal IP addresses communicate with each other privately.
3. Each VM have a unique internal ip address in a vpc network.

 === How Internal IP Address is  ===
Each subnet have their IP range
4. Auto:
	- In Auto mode VPC: automatically selected if available.
5. Custom:
	- In Custom VPC: must be selected manually.

 === Internal IP addressing ===
6. Alias IP:
+ Configure multiple internal IP Addresses, representing containers or applications hosted in a VM, without using a seperate network interface.
+ IP ranges can be assigned from the subnet's primary or secondary ranges.

7. Ephemeral IP:
+ The IP address comes from the region's subnet
+ IP Addresses are released only when the instance or forwarding rule is deleted.

8. Static IP:
+ We can promote Ephemeral IP to Static IP
+ You must specify which subnet the IP address comes from
+ Assigns the IP address to your project until  you explicitly release it.


* External:

=== External IP addressing ===
1. External IP addresses are needed to communicate with the internet, with resources in another network, or a public Google Cloud service.
2. Sources from outside a Google Cloud VPC network can address a specific resource by the external IP address.
3. Only resources with an external IP address can send and receive traffic directly to and from outside the network.

4. Ephemeral IP:
+ Automatically assigned
+ IP addresses are released when stopping and restarting or deleting.

5. Static IP:
+ We can promote Ephemeral to Static.
+ Assign the IP address to your project until you explicitly release it.
+ Available as a regional or global resource.


		****** Internal IP address reservation ******
1. Reserve a specific address and then associate it with a specific resource.
2. Specify an ephemeral internal ip address for a resource and then promote the address



		****** VPC Firewall rules ******

=== Implied and pre-populated rules ===
1. Google Cloud have some rules that can affect incoming or outgoing connections.
2. For instance, Google Cloud does not allow certain ip protocol such as egress traffic on tcp port 25 within a VPC network.
3. Google Cloud does not allow ingress traffic of TCP, UDP, ICMP, GRE to external ip addresses of gg cloud resources.
4. Google Cloud always allow communication between a VM instance and its corresponding Metadata Server on 169.254.169.254.
5. Metadat server provides some basic services to the instance like: DHCP, DNS, Instance Metadata, NTP (network time protocol).
6. Every network has 2 implied firewall rules that permit outgoing connections and block incoming connections.
7. Implied Rules:
	- Allow egress: the action is 'allow' and the destination is 'all ips' (priority is the lowest possible) except for traffic blocked by Google Cloud.
	- Deny ingress: the action is 'deny' and the source is 'all ips' (priority is the lowest possible) and protects all VM instances by blocking incoming connections.

=== Firewall rule characteristics ===
1. Firewall rules applied to incoming or outgoing connection (not both).
2. Firewall rules only support ipv4 address or ipv4 block for connections.
3. Firewall rules action is either allow or deny (not both at the same time).
4. When creating Firewall rules, we need to select a VPC network.
5. Firewall rules is stateful, that means the firewall keeps track of the state of network connections and use this informations to manage network traffic.



		****** VPC Peering ******
1. Private connectivity accross two VPC networks (RFC 1918).
2. Peer across the same or different projects and organizations.
3. Reduces network latency.
4. Increases network security.
5. Reduces network costs.
