Each VM have at least one Boot Persistent Disk volume that contains the operating system.

When your apps require additional storage space, one possible solution is to attach additional Persistent Disk volumes to your VM.

A VM can have many attached disks to it.

1.To check how many attached disks to a Linux VM: 
 - ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/google-*

2. Format the disk device using mkfs tool:
 -  sudo mkfs.ext4 -m 0 -E lazy_itable_init=0,lazy_journal_init=0,discard /dev/DEVICE_NAME
 
3. Mount the disk:
 - Step 1 (create a directory that serves as the mounted point for a disk on the VM): sudo mkdir -p /mnt/disks/MOUNT_DIR
 - Step 2 (Use the mount tool to mount the disk to the instance, and enable the discard option): sudo mount -o discard,defaults /dev/DEVICE_NAME /mnt/disks/MOUNT_DIR
 - Step 3 (Configured read and write permission on the disk): sudo chmod a+w /mnt/disks/MOUNT_DIR


Ex for step 2: sudo mount -o discard,defaults /dev/sdb /mnt/disks/docker images


sudo mount -o discard,defaults /dev/sdc /var/opt/mssql
