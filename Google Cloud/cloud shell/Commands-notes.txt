Cloud Shell instance is a vm that run debian-based linux OS. So when we work with Cloud Shell, we work with debian.

==============================================================================

1. df -h/ df: to check disk storage

2. curl metadata/computeMetadata/v1/instance/zone: to get the zone where the instance is located

3. ls: to get viewed items in the current directory

4. ls -al: to get all (include hidden)

5. touch <file_name>: to create new file

6. gcloud compute networks subnets expand-ip-range <network_name> --region=<region_name> --prefix-length=16: to change the prefix of ip range of a subnet of region in a network to 16
ex: gcloud compute networks subnets expand-ip-range default --region=us-west1 --prefix-length=16

7. gcloud compute networks subnets describe <subnet_name> --region=<region_name>: to get description of a subnet in a region

8. gcloud compute addresses list: to view all internal and external ip addresses that are available.

9. gcloud compute addresses create <ip_address_name> --addresses <external_ip_address> --region <region_name>: to promote a phemeral external ip address of a region to static external ip address.

10. gcloud compute addresses delete <ip_address_name> --region <region_name>: to delete (release) a reserved ip address in a region (specify the name of ip address that we want to delete).

11. If a VM instance have a permission for read/write api to cloud storage(bucket), we can use this command to get all files of the bucket
- gsutil ls gs://<bucket_name>: get all files of a bucket identified by its name.

12. ping <ip_address>: to ping a server (that server must support icmp protocol).

13. gcloud compute ssh --project <project_name/project_id> --zone <zone_name> <instance_name> --internal-ip: use gcloud shell to ssh to VM instance of a project on a zone using internal ip.
